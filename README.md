- 👋 Hi, I’m @agric812.
- 👀 I’m interested in agriculture data analysis, which involves using data to make informed decisions to improve agricultural practices and outcomes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced data analysis techniques, machine learning, and how to apply these in agricultural contexts to optimize crop yields, manage resources efficiently, and predict trends.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to precision agriculture, data-driven farming solutions, and research that leverages big data to tackle agricultural challenges.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the use of drones in agriculture can reduce the use of pesticides by 30% and increase crop yields by 15%?
